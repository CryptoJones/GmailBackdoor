# GmailBackdoor
A simple C2 program using Gmail or another IMAP service.

In the app.config file, you'll need to set an email to send from along with the password, and a receive to, and they can be the same.  This is tested on Gmail, but should be fine with other IMAP services.

You can change the encrption key and other settings in the app.config file, but its not necessary.
